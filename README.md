## Fingerprinting FAQs
What is the difference between a fingerprint-based background check and a non-fingerprint background check?
Fingerprint-based background checks run job applicants through both FBI and state criminal databases to create a complete criminal profile of the job applicant. Conversely, non-fingerprint background checks, or “name checks,” are not nearly as comprehensive and run the applicants background against a limited amount of predetermined records that are commercially available. Modern automated fingerprint identification systems can produce identification error rates of less than one percent. Conversely, as compared to FBI fingerprint searches, “name checks” result in appreciable numbers of both false positives and false negatives.


## Are “name checks” as reliable as fingerprints in criminal history checks?
In general, name checks are much less reliable than fingerprints. A name check is based on an individual’s name and personal identifiers such as sex, race, date of birth and Social Security number. Because it is rare for this information to be unique to particular individuals, name checks can produce inaccurate results, especially when names and other identifiers in the database are similar or identical to the information being checked. Mistakes can also result from misspellings, clerical errors or inaccurate identification information intentionally provided by search subjects who wish to avoid discovery of their prior criminal activities.

There are two general types of name check errors:

Inaccurate or wrong identifications, often called “false positives,” occur when an applicant’s name check does not clear, producing one or more possible candidates. Also, the applicant’s fingerprint search does clear, showing the applicant has no FBI criminal record.
Missed identifications, often called “false negatives,” occur when an applicant’s name check clears, producing no possible candidates, and the applicant’s fingerprint search does not clear but instead shows the applicant has an FBI criminal record.

## What is Live Scan Fingerprinting?
Live scan fingerprinting is the process of capturing fingerprints electronically with our advanced Live Scan machine. With Live Scan fingerprinting, there is no ink or card. Your fingerprints are “rolled” across a glass plate and scanned. It is faster, cleaner and more accurate than the old ink and roll method.

A percentage of the population have difficult to read fingerprints, which can be affected by age or exposure to certain types of work such as construction or from prolonged exposure to various chemicals. Our state-of-the-art equipment and highly trained staff are able to maximize the quality of fingerprint images obtained, which reduces the likelihood of illegible fingerprints and will reduce the overall application processing time. The fingerprints are then submitted to the specific state or federal agency to process.
